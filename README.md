## What is Simpler?
### A way to breakdown tasks to achieve efficiency

All too often, we make mental notes of tasks that need to be accomplished and we end up not completing them. A task needs to be broken down into smaller steps so we are able to have steps that are clearly laid out that can help us achieve our goals. Simpler allows you to break a task down so you can easily visualize what needs to be done step-by-step.

Example: "Make a website" This is too broad and doesn't define anything or have any real steps.

Break down the task into simpler steps that helps you finish the goal.
